                        I am a motivated Master's candidate in Information Systems at Northeastern University with a strong foundation in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from NIT Warangal. As an Analyst - Java Full Stack Developer at Deloitte Consulting India Private Limited, I led transformative initiatives in modernizing data loaders and optimizing citizen portal modules, showcasing proficiency in technologies like Spring, Angular, and Node. My project portfolio, including a React Weather App and a Cloud Cafeteria digital solution, reflects my passion for innovation and problem-solving. Beyond academics, I have actively engaged in leadership roles, serving as a Technical Team Lead at the Center of Innovation and Incubation and earning recognition in the Vechain X BCG hackathon at Harvard University. With a commitment to driving positive change in the technology landscape, I am eager to contribute my skills to impactful projects and continue my journey of growth and innovation.
